# Particle Compute Shader for MonoGame

![Screenshots](https://github.com/cpt-max/MonoGame-Shader-Samples/blob/overview/Screenshots/ComputeParticles.jpg?raw=true)

This sample uses a compute shader to update particles on the GPU. 
The particle buffer is used directly by the vertex shader that draws the particles. Since no data needs to be downloaded to the CPU, this method is very fast.

For the FPS counter to make sense, you have to outcomment 2 lines
```
graphics.SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace = false;
IsFixedTimeStep = false;
```

### Build for OpenGL
- Open ShaderTestGL.csproj.
- Make sure MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL from this [MonoGame fork](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/7533) is referenced.
- Rebuild the content in ShaderTestGL.mgcb using the MGCB Editor from that fork.

### Build for DirectX
- Open ShaderTestDX.csproj.
- Make sure MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX from this [MonoGame fork](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/7533) is referenced. 
- Rebuild the content in ShaderTestDX.mgcb using the MGCB Editor from that fork.
