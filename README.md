Hull, Domain and Geometry shader sample for MonoGame. 

This sample project needs to reference MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX from this MonoGame branch:
https://github.com/cpt-max/MonoGame/tree/shader

Also the content included with this sample (ShaderTest.mgcb) needs to be compiled with the pipeline tool from this branch. The mgfxc.exe shader compiler has been modified.
Currently only WindowsDX is working.

Thanks to JSandusky as this work is based on his MonoGame fork:
